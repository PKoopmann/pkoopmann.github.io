I will be giving the Knowledge Representation lecture for students in
the Master's program for Artificial Intelligence in period 2 of
academic year 2023/2024, as well as the Logic and Sets lecture for the
Bachelor for Artificial Intelligence.



If you want to do a bachelor or master thesis, don't be afraid to send
me an email. I have a range of topics on my webpage, and I can give
you additional information based on your experience, skills and
interests. If you have your own idea, we can discuss it to see whether
it is feasible, whether I am the right supervisor, or whether there
are similar directions that would be better suited. One warning: even
though my expertise is in a subfield of artificial intelligence, I
will not supervise theses with a focus on deep learning, large
language models or image recognition. My focus is on symbolic AI, that
is, knowledge representation and logic-based AI. Consequently, theses
topics will have to be related to those fields.
