## Buying Drugstore Items

Many light medicines such as paracetamol and cetirizine can just be bought at a supermarket, usually at a quite cheap price.

For those who come with a plane and without liquids, and need for instance to buy sunscreen, but don't want to pay a

## Buying tickets for public transport

In the Netherlands, you can use your debit or credit card as a ticket for public transport: when going through the controls at the trainstation, 
or checking in at a tram or bus, most people just use their bank card, which you just tap against where you would otherwise tap your ticket. 
When you then check out again, the required amount for your trip is booked off your account.

This convenient way of buying tickets is the reason why you won't find many ticket machines around.
