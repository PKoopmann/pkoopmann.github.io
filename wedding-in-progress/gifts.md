# Gifts

**We are not expecting any gift!**

We know how expensive it is for all of you to join us for this
special moment, and we are extremely thankful for that!
Perhaps a nice card with a personal message would be a
very nice memory of you being there!

For those that say “Hey, we anyway want to give you
something”, we would like to say: we already live together,
have a fully furnished apartment, and very little space left
for objects, which is why we did not create a wish list.

Still not happy and you still insist on giving us
something more than your presence or your card?
Then, you could give a small contribution to our
honeymoon in Mexico, on Riviera Maya,
happening on October, here:
