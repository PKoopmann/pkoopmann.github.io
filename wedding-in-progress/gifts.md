# Gifts

We are not expecting any gift!


We know how expensive it is for all of you to join us for this
special moment, and we are extremely thankful for that!
Perhaps a nice card with a personal message would be a
very nice memory of you being there!


For those that say “Hey, we anyway want to give you
something”, we would like to say: we already live together,
have a fully furnished apartment, and very little space left
for objects, which is why we did not create a wish list.


Still not happy and you still insist on giving us
something more than your presence or your card?
Then, you could give a small contribution to our
honeymoon in Mexico, on Riviera Maya,
happening on October, here:

the wedding day!)
