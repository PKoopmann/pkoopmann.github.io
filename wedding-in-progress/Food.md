# Wedding day programme

The wedding day programme is as follows:

- Wedding liturgy in the Church of Overveen (15:00)
- pics with the guests (16:00)
- everyone heads to the Ambassador by 18:00, while we take some pics in the city centre
- Reception and dinner at the Ambassador (until around 20:00)
- Cake followed by party (until 24:00)


# Food

The food on the wedding day might not be what you are used to. This is why we think it's a good idea to share with you beforehand.

### Dinner with three courses (adults):

- a fish-based starter*
- a vegetarian course
- a meat-based course*

#### Kids and young adults 

The kids and young adults will have, as alternative to the adults menu, a kid-friendly two course meal.

### Wedding cake

### Late evening Dutch snacks

### Midnight fries

*vegetarian alternative for those who notified us
