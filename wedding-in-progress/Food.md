# Food on the wedding day

The food on the wedding day might not be what you are used to. This is why we think it's a good idea to share with you beforehand.

### Dinner with three courses (adults):

- a fish-based starter*
- a vegetarian course
- a meat-based course*

#### Kids and young adults 

The kids and young adults will have, as alternative to the adults menu, a kid-friendly two course meal.

### Wedding cake

### Late evening Dutch snacks

### Midnight fries

*vegetarian alternative for those who notified us
