# Gifts

**We are not expecting any gift!**


We know how expensive it is for all of you to join us for this
special moment, and we are extremely thankful for that!
Perhaps a nice card with a personal message would be a
very nice memory of you being there!

For those who say “Hey, we anyway want to give you
something” and they wonder if we created a wedding registry with things we need for our home, we would like to say: we already live together,
have a fully furnished apartment, and very little space left
for objects, which is why we did not create a wish list.

Still not happy and you still insist on giving us
something more than your presence or your card?
Then, if you want to, you could give a small contribution to our
honeymoon in Mexico, on Riviera Maya,
happening on October

For security and privacy reasons, our details are not shared here, see email sent by Patrick on 24th of July.

(please add a note so we know who you are :))

**IMPORTANT: please no cash on
the wedding day!**

The venue is a hotel and we want to avoid to leave valuables laying around.
